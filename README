A pure Java clone of Basho's BitCask.

todo
1. Configurable fsync behavior, async notification of sync with latency and compression results
2. Write hint files as you go (saw this reviewing BitCask commits)
3. Add utilization/fragmentation stats for each cask, regenerate stats on reload
4. Compaction triggered by stats
5. Multi-threaded hint file reloading
6. Off heap zero fragmentation key storage with responsive RSS
7. Network interface
8. Naive async replication. Recovery is always a full sync. Manual slave promotion. Slave is readable only until promotion
9. Stored procedures, in a language where not everything is a floating point number (j/k)
